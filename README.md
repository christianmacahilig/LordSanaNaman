üìù Overview
This system is designed to assist students and faculty in accurately classifying research proposals according to their academic domain‚ÄîCS or IT. By extracting keywords from key sections of the proposal (Title, Rationale, Objectives, Scope and Limitations), and applying a scoring formula, the system determines the most relevant classification. It enhances evaluation accuracy, reduces subjectivity, and supports faster review processes.

üìå How It Works
User Selects Course

On the homepage, users choose between CS or IT.

This serves as a benchmark for comparison with the system's output.

Proposal Submission

Users input the text from their research proposal including the Title, Rationale, Objectives, and Scope.

Keyword Extraction & Scoring

The system identifies keywords based on a curated list from CHED/IEEE.

Scores are calculated per section:

Title: SUM(keywords) √ó (25 / 50)

Rationale + Objectives + Scope: SUM(keywords) √ó (25 / 250)

Classification & Match Check

The system sums the scores for CS and IT. The higher total determines the classification.

The result is compared with the user's selected course to determine a match or mismatch.
